# Architecture Directory Governance and Contract

This directory serves as the authoritative Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for internal technical governance, requirements specifications, architectural trade-offs, and implementation blueprints for the `ed-telemetry` project under the Unified Process (UP).

## 1. Dual-Root Partition

* **Maintainer / Engineering Plane (`architecture/`):** Reserved exclusively for internal engineering ledgers, formal requirements, design documents, and decision records.
* **Customer / Operator Plane (`docs/`):** Reserved exclusively for living, mutable user-facing manuals and runbooks governed by the Diátaxis framework.
